This package contains functions that incrementally wrap (or "corral")
s-expressions with delimiters, such as parentheses and brackets.
After calling one of the interactive commands, repeated calls will shift
the corral instead of inserting new delimiters, expanding the amount of
text contained within the delimiters.
